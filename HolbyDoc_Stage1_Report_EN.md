## 2. Selected MVP Concept

**Project Name:** HolbyDoc

**Project Summary:**  
HolbyDoc is an online documentation platform centralizing resources, explanations, summaries, and practical guides related to Holberton School training. It aims to simplify the understanding of projects and technical concepts while promoting collaboration among students.

**Problem Solved:**  
Holberton School students often encounter difficulties finding clear explanations or organized resources. Documents are frequently scattered or lack proper context.  
HolbyDoc centralizes and structures essential resources, facilitating autonomous and collaborative learning.

**Reasons for Selection:**  
- Direct utility: addresses a real need for Holberton School students  
- Technical feasibility: implementation possible with HTML/CSS/JS, Flask or Django, Markdown, SQLAlchemy database  
- Strong connection to the current training program  
- Scalability: possibility to add advanced search, community contributions, tagging, etc.  
- Potential impact: reusable tool for other cohorts and campuses

**Potential Challenges:**  
- Logical content structuring (hierarchy, navigation, filters)  
- Maintaining content quality and consistency  
- Implementing a controlled contribution system  

**Opportunities:**  
- Reference tool for all Holberton students  
- Medium-term community development  
- Deployment as public documentation or internal resource (intranet)

**Target Audience:**  
- Holberton students (all levels)  
- Newcomers seeking guidance in the program  
- Alumni wanting to quickly find key resources
